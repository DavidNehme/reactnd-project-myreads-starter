# MyReads Project

Displays a list of books, orgainized into "bookshelves" categorized by
the state, if each book being read, already read, or planned to be read.
Stores the book lists on a remote server. Also includes a search
for additional books.

## TL;DR

- install all project dependencies with `npm install`
- start the development server with `npm start`
